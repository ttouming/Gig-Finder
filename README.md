# Gig-Finder
## Description
As a live music lover, I always want to find out the location of local event venues when I travel to a new place. 
Normally, I had to search the current music events on venues’ websites. To get more information about the performers, I had to search the performers’ name on google or social media site. Additionally, I had to search the performers’ artwork by using music stream services or youtube. Finally, I could know if I would like the events or not.
The mashup app aims to provide a clean view of some basic information of current musical shows and a short video at the same time for user to have a quick understand to the event and the performers. In the mashup app, users can search current events in the map which are indicated by markers. By clicking the marker, users can look into some more information of the event. There is also a search bar that can help user to locate the entered city on the map.

## User Guide
User can see a simple web app that has a map, search bar, and a table once they enter the website.
